My take on how r/Eminem should look

My aim for this was to make r/Eminem feel like [Eminem's current website](http://eminem.com), with the dark colours (red/grey/black).  
I'm a fan of dark backgrounds personally, I code on a dark background and use night themes in apps such as reddit and Twitter.  
This design makes use of the [SVG redesign of Eminem's logo](http://github.com/Markshall/EminemLogoSVG) that I created.

r/Eminem currently uses a middle-finger icon as the cursor when you hover over links, I decided to keep that, but also use it for the karma voting buttons, but only have the actual middle finger pop up when you hover over it. The middle-finger cursor isn't activated for this so there isn't any 'overkill'.  
I've never really been a fan of the generic 'my subreddits' area on reddit, so I decided to use flex-box and CSS animations to keep it looking cleaner and organised.

## Features

### Desktop

## Mobile
This design has very minimal mobile responsiveness due to it only being a time-passer, and reddit already having a mobile app. I may make it fully responsive in the future.
